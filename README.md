# README: Cub3D

## Objectives
This project aims to develop your C programming skills while exploring the field of graphic design. Inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D, Cub3D provides an immersive experience by creating a realistic 3D representation within a labyrinth, using ray-casting as its fundamental principle.

## Rules
- C project with adherence to the Norm.
- No unexpected termination.
- No memory leaks.
- Makefile with standard and bonus rules.
- Allowed use of libft.
- Parsing of a map from a description file.

## Mandatory Part
- **Name:** `cub3D`
- **Files:** All.
- **Makefile:** all, clean, fclean, re, bonus.
- **Arguments:** A *.cub map.
- **External Functions:** open, close, read, write, printf, malloc, free, lib math, MinilibX.
- **Libft:** Allowed.
- **Description:** Realistic 3D graphic representation with ray-casting.

## Examples
- [Wolfeinstein3D](http://users.atw.hu/wolf3d/)

## Usage
1. Run the command `make all` to compile the Cub3D project.
2. Execute the game using the following command: `./cub3d [map]`

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to rotate the camera (look left and right).
- Move the character with the keys W, A, S, and D.
- Press ESC or Click the red cross on the window click the red cross on the window to close the window and exit the game.
