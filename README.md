# README: Cub3D

## Objectives
This project aims to develop your C programming skills while exploring the field of graphic design. Inspired by the game Wolfenstein 3D, Cub3D provides an immersive experience by creating a realistic 3D representation within a labyrinth, using ray-casting as its fundamental principle.

## Rules
- C project with adherence to the Norm.
- No unexpected termination.
- No memory leaks.
- Makefile with standard and bonus rules.
- Allowed use of libft.
- Parsing of a map from a description file.
